Consistently train myself to overcome diversity of difficulty.

'열정이라는 의미의 “passion”이라는 말은 라틴어 pati에서 왔습니다. 이는 **“to suffer, endure”** 의 뜻으로 고통을 겪었다, 견디어 내다라는 뜻을 가지고 있습니다.'

### The importance of thinking at the overall view. 
Humans instinctively feels the death and life itself. It means the concept of beginning is given at the certain unknown point.
We can feel the end(death). We afraid it. Nothings going to be changed. Everything is beginning at the point. Everything is getting end at the point. Have you ever thinking about that this end point & beginning point are crossorigined at the mysterious way? This is the real difference. Reasoning over. We need to change our views to overly. That's what I'm talking about.
