Hi I'm Chris Kwak. (Seungmin Kwak)

I was born in December 6th, 1998 I'm male.

I live in South Korea.

I'm programming Life through encounter & solving the various events. 
(I love computer programming, trip to foregin countries, dancing, singing, reading , tattooing, fall into deep Love.)

Get yourself brave and do not give up young souls. Be the passion itself.

<'열정이라는 의미의 “passion”이라는 말은 라틴어 pati에서 비롯되었다. 이는 “to suffer, endure”의 뜻으로 고통을 겪었다, 견디어 내다라는 뜻을 가지고 있습니다.'>

저는 삶이라는 여행을 온몸으로 겪고 성장합니다.
 
일상에 똬리를 튼 다양한 문제들에 구체적으로 접근해서 풀어내고 개선시켜 발전합니다. 

변화와 혁신은 저를 표현하는 Identity 입니다. 

반갑습니다.

The importance of thinking at the overall view. 

Humans instinctively feels the death and life itself. It means the concept of beginning is given at the certain unknown point.
We can feel the end(death). We afraid it. Nothings going to be changed. Everything is beginning at the point. Everything is getting end at the point. Have you ever thinking about that this end point & beginning point are crossorigined at the mysterious way? This is the real difference. Reasoning over. We need to change our views to overly. That's what I'm talking about.
